# communication-ux-devs
In this repo I include the files used in my blog post to illustrate how communication between UX teams and developer teams can be improved.

This repo includes:
- The Figma file `communication-ux-devs.fig` where all versions of the same design can be checked (messy design, component based design, variants & variables based design).
- The export export created by the Design Tokens Manager plugin, included in the folder `design-tokens`.
